## Business Requirements
F: We want to have a carpool app that is only for FAST students, faculty and staff. There's no existing dedicated carpool app so they all find it hectic managing multiple carpool groups.  
U: Are there any reasons other than hectic WhatsApp groups?  
F: Yes, we've got complaints from both parents and students that they feel unsafe to send students on uncomfortable public transport. Also, they want a trusted carpool instead.  
U: Is there any other reason that comes to your mind... Maybe something students complain about that WhatsApp doesn't provide like payments or something?  
F: Oh yes! But only once or twice we got complaint that WhatsApp leads to delay in bargaining for both available rides or even those missed by driver or passenger.
